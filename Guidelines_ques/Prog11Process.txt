Creating a complete implementation for your requirements involves both client-side 
(HTML, JavaScript) and server-side (Node.js with Express, MySQL) code. Below is a 
simple example to get you started. Please note that this is a basic example, and you
 may need to enhance it based on your specific requirements.

Step 1 : Server-side code (Node.js with Express and MySQL)
Install the necessary Node.js packages
Open cmd and type
npm install express mysql

Step 2 : Create a file named prog11.js

Step 3 : 2. Client-side code (HTML)
Create a file named prog11.html:

Step 4 : 3. Create a "public" directory and place prog12.html inside it.
Run your Node.js server:
Open cmd and run node prog11.js

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the HTML page and test the sign-in and sign-up functionality.

Please replace the placeholder values in the server code (MySQL credentials) with your
actual database information. Additionally, consider using secure practices for 
handling passwords (e.g., hashing). This example provides a basic structure that you
can build upon based on your project's requirements.
