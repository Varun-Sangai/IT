Program 

Step 1 : Run ipconfig in cmd 

Step 2 : Find your IP address and subnet mask:
Look for the "IPv4 Address" and "Subnet Mask" entries for the network adapter you're using.

Note : If you are connected to a Wi-Fi network, you should look for the information under the 
"Wireless LAN adapter WiFi" section. If you are using a wired connection, you might 
find it under "Wireless LAN adapter Local Area Connection * 2" or a similar name.

Step 3 : Calculate Network address : 
Perform a bitwise AND operation between your IP address and the subnet mask. 

Step 4 : Calculate the Maximum Number of Systems:
Formula = 2^(32 - subnet mask length) or 2^Host bits
Subnet Mask Length = No. of Network bits

Step 5 : Determine the Range of IP Addresses:
The range typically goes from the network address to the broadcast address.
That is all host bits 0 to 1 excluding network and broadcast address
Example Network address = 192.168.1.0 so Range is 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254

Description about ipconfig  => 
The "ipconfig" command is a command-line tool used in Windows operating systems to
display and manage the network configuration of a computer. 
When you run "ipconfig" in the Command Prompt, 
it provides information about the computer's IP configuration, 
including the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for each 
network interface.

1. ipconfig /all: Displays detailed information about all network interfaces, 
including physical and virtual adapters, along with additional information 
such as DNS servers, DHCP server, and more.

2. ipconfig /release: Releases the IP address assigned to all network interfaces.

3. ipconfig /renew: Renews the IP address for all network interfaces. 
This is often used to obtain a new IP address from a DHCP server.

4. ipconfig /flushdns: Flushes and resets the DNS resolver cache,
 which can be useful for resolving DNS-related issues.
