Step 1 : Save Prog10.js
Step 2 : Then open cmd type node Prog10.js
@This will start the server on port 10000. If port 10000 is already in use, 
the server will automatically try the next available port.
@Now, if you open your web browser and go to http://localhost:10000/, you should 
see the message "Hello world, This is my Node.js server" displayed.
Step 3 : If you want to dynamically find a free port, 
you can run the Prog10B.js
@This modification will increment the port number until it finds an available one.
