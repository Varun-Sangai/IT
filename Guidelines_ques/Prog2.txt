Program

Step 1 : Ping :
# Open cmd and type " ping IpAddress/Website link " and then press enter
Here IP Address is the ip address of system you want to check or ping
And Website link could be any in form www.google.com or chat.openai.com

If you receive a response with round-trip times and no errors, it indicates 
that the systems are connected.
; 

Step 2 : Tracert  
To trace the route to the target system, use the following command:
# tracert <IP_Address_of_Target_System>
This command will show you the route taken to reach the target system.

Step 3 : List Processes Using Ports 
you can use the netstat command. 
@Open cmd and type ( netstat -ano | find "TCP" )
This will display a list of processes using TCP ports along with their Process IDs (PID). 

To find detailed information about a specific PID,
you can use the Task Manager or the tasklist command:
@ Open cmd type ( tasklist /fi "pid eq <PID>" )

Description : 

Ping: 
The PING command is used to test the connection and latency between two network 
connections. The PING command sends packets of information to a specified 
IP Address and then measures the time it takes to get a response from the specified 
computer or device.

This command sends a series of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request
packets to the specified host (in this case, "www.example.com") and displays the 
round-trip time for each packet.

After you run the command , If the website is up and actively responding, you 
receive replies back from the server that you pinged with the following information:
  a. The IP address
  b. The number of Bytes sent
  c. The time it took in milliseconds
  d. Any information loss during transit

Tracert:

The TRACERT command which means trace route is used to conduct a similar test to 
PING, but instead of displaying the time it takes to connect, it looks at the exact 
server hops required to connect your computer to the server.

This command sends packets to the destination with increasing Time-to-Live (TTL) 
values, causing routers along the path to respond with ICMP time exceeded messages. 
By analyzing these responses, traceroute can determine the route packets take to 
reach the destination.

After you run the command , If the website is up and actively responding, you 
receive replies back from the server that you pinged with the following information:
  a. The number of hops to reach the server from your computer.

Both ping and traceroute are valuable tools for network troubleshooting. Ping helps 
you check basic connectivity and measure latency, while traceroute provides insights
into the path packets take through the network, helping identify potential issues or
bottlenecks. Keep in mind that some networks may block or limit responses to ICMP 
packets, which can affect the accuracy of these tools in certain situations.

Netstat : 

netstat, which stands for "network statistics," is a command-line tool used to display
various network-related information on a computer running a TCP/IP protocol stack. 
It is available on most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Unix-like 
systems. The netstat command provides information about network connections, routing
tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and other network-related 
details.

Here are some common uses of the netstat command: 

1. netstat -a
This command shows all active network connections, including listening and 
established connections.

2. netstat -l
This command shows all listening ports on the system.

3. netstat -s 
This command displays various network statistics, such as the number of packets sent
and received.

4. netstat -r
This command shows the routing table, indicating how network traffic is directed.

5. netstat -p
This command shows the Process ID (PID) associated with each network connection.

6. netstat -e
This command provides extended information, including Ethernet statistics.
