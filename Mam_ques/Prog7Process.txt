Step 1 : create a JSON file named prog7.json with the JSON data of a few pets. You 
can copy the console output from the prog6.html and paste it into the 
prog7.json file.

Step 2 : create an HTML file that uses AJAX to load the data from the pets.json file
and displays it in a presentable way using HTML and CSS.

@This HTML file uses AJAX to load the data from pets.json and then dynamically 
creates HTML elements to display the pet information. The styling is kept simple for
demonstration purposes, and you can customize it further based on your preferences.
